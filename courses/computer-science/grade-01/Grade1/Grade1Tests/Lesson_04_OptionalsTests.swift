 Lesson 04: Optionals

 A special type exists called, `nil`. `nil` represents the absence of a value.

 `nil` can help us determine if we have yet to set a value to a variable.

 If a variable can contain a `nil` value, the variable is referred to as an "optional" value. It is used exactly as you would imagine. The value is optional! It can either exist or not exist.

         Below we create an optional `String` value.

         Simply, we may or may not have a value in the `optionalName` variable.

         The nil-coalesce operator

         The double question marks, `??`, are called the nil-coalescing operator. It's a built-in Swift convenience function.

         The `print` function requires a non-optional `String` value. In other words, `print` _requires_ that we pass it a `String` value. In order to send a non-optional `String` value, we must "coalesce" the optional value with a non-optional value.

         Coalesce means to join together, combine, or merge.

         In practice, what this means is that we will use the value from our optional variable first, _or_ the non-optional value if no value has been assigned to our variable.

         In the previous test, if `optionalName` contained a `nil` value, the string value `"Bob"` would be used instead.

         Let's see an example where the nil-coelescing operator provides the non-optional value when our variable contains a `nil` value.

         If `teacherName` is assigned a value, the `if let` operator will assign it to a new non-optional `name` variable. We can then use the `name` variable in our conditional block.

         ---

         `if let` will not execute the conditional block if `teacherName` is `nil`.

         Once a value has been set to `teacherName`, the conditional block will execute!
