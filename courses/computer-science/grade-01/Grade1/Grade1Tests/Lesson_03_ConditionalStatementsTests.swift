         The `if` statement

         `if` statements evaluate "expressions." An expression is determined by using operators that produce a `Bool` value. We've already talked about these operators in our Data Types: Boolean section. There are Comparison Operators and Logical Operators.

         Here are some examples of an expression:
           - `1 < 2`
           - `5 == 5`
           - `true && false`
           - `true || true`

         When an expression evaluates to `true` the code inside the `if` block is executed.

         Change the `housePrice` to make these test pass.

        let housePrice = 99.00

        }

        /**
         Now we have a way to change the behavior of our program if the expression is `true` or `false`.

         ---

         NOTE: You may have noticed that the `bikePrice` is defined as `1_000.00`. What is with the underscore (_) between the `1` and `0`s? Swift gives us a way to format numeric values that represent how we format numbers in our day-to-day. For example, we represent one thousand as "1,000" in our day-to-day. However, we can't use "1,000" in a computer program as the comma (,) is not understood as a valid command. To get around this, Swift allows us to substitute the comma (,) with an underscore (_). This formatting is helpful when our numbers are large!

         For example, this is a valid number, but is not easy to read.
         `10000000`

         We can add the undescore (_) to the number above, and now it easily reads as 10 million.
         `10_000_000`

         Back to `if` statements!

         The `else if` statement

         The `else if` statement allows us to perform more than two behaviors.

         A common statement if statement may be, "What should I eat for breakfast?" It depends!

         Ideally, we want a healthy breakfast. Therefore, you may make miso soup (a common Japanese breakfast meal).

         However, if you don't want to healthy, but you have milk, maybe you'll have a bowl of cereal.

         If you don't want to take the time to be healthy, or have milk, you may decide to eat nothing!

         Below is a translation of these `if` statements.
